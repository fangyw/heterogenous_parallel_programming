Heterogenous Parallel Programming
---------------------------------

This course introduces concepts, languages techniques, and patterns for programming heterogeous, massively parallel processors. It covers heterogenous computing architectures, data-parallel programming models, techniques for memory bandwidth management, and parallel algorithm patterns.

## About the course
This course is designed for students to learn the essence of low-level programming interfaces and how to use these interfaces to achieve application goals. CUDA C, with its good balance between user control and verboseness, will serve  as the teaching vehicle for the first half of the course. Students will then extend their learning into closely related programming interfaces such as OpenCL, OpenACC, and C++AMP.

2. <Nvidia, Nvidia CUDA C Programming Guide>


## FAQs
1. Why not teach the whole course using OpenCL?

While OpenCL is an industry standard and widely supported by many CPU and GPU vendors, it is much more complex and tedious to use than CUDA. The complexity and tedious details distract from the concepts and techniques that one should master. From our experience, it is much more productive to use CUDA to teach the concepts and techniques. We will then teach the additional complexities of OpenCL so that students can comfortably apply all the concepts to OpenCL.
